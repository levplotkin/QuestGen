Agentic AI transforms Dungeons & Dragons gameplay by creating dynamic, responsive narratives and managing complex game mechanics autonomously. Unlike static AI tools, agentic systems use goal-driven architectures to simulate human-like Game Master (GM) capabilities, adapting to player choices in real-time while maintaining narrative coherence and mechanical balance.

Future Features:
- Multilanguage Support
