# QuestGen

Agentic AI transforms Dungeons & Dragons gameplay by creating dynamic, responsive narratives and managing complex game mechanics autonomously. Unlike static AI tools, agentic systems use goal-driven architectures to simulate human-like Game Master (GM) capabilities, adapting to player choices in real-time while maintaining narrative coherence and mechanical balance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Game Sessions**: Create and join game sessions with unique identifiers
- **Interactive Lobby**: View and manage active game sessions
- **Real-time Chat**: Built-in chat for player communication
- **Game History**: Track game progress and events
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extensible with new agents and services
