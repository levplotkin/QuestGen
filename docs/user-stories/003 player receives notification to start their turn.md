As a player, when it becomes my turn in the game session,
I want to receive a clear notification and, upon continuing, see a concise reminder of the story so far and a description of my current situation, so that I am oriented and ready to take my action.

Acceptance Criteria:

When it is the player’s turn, they receive a notification (in-app, push, or email depending on settings) indicating it is their turn to act.

The notification remains visible until the player acknowledges it and is ready to proceed.

Upon clicking “Continue” or a similar prompt:

The player is shown a brief summary of the story so far, highlighting recent events and key developments relevant to their character.

The current situation is described in detail, including location, nearby NPCs or threats, and any immediate objectives or options.

The player is then prompted to choose or input their action for the turn.

If the player is new to the session and has not created a character, they are redirected to the character creation flow before seeing the story and situation summary.
