As a player, when the game session ends, 
I want to receive a clear summary of the adventure’s conclusion, see any rewards or experience earned, and have the opportunity to reflect on the story and my character’s achievements, 
so that I have a sense of closure and accomplishment at the end of the session.

Acceptance Criteria:

When the session ends (either at a scheduled time or a narrative conclusion), the system displays a clear notification that the game has ended.

The player is presented with a summary of the adventure’s outcome, including key events, completed objectives, and the fate of their character.

Any earned rewards, experience points, or level-ups are shown, along with a breakdown of how they were achieved.

The player can view a recap of their character’s actions and contributions to the story.

There is an opportunity for players to leave feedback or comments on the session.

The system provides options to save or export the session summary and character progress for future reference.

Players are informed about possible next steps, such as joining a new session, continuing the campaign in a future session, or reviewing session highlights.
