As a player, when it is not my turn or I am not taking an action,
I want to continuously see the gameâ€™s progress in a side panel

Acceptance Criteria:

The side panel is always visible in the UI, displaying a live feed of recent game events, story updates, and actions taken by other players.

The panel updates in real time as the game progresses, ensuring the player is aware of the current state and narrative developments.

The main area of the UI remains uncluttered, focusing on the story or current player actions, while the side panel handles ongoing updates.

The UI design is consistent and intuitive, minimizing clutter and ensuring that essential information is always accessible without overwhelming the player.

The player can continue to observe, and prepare for their next turn without needing to refresh or navigate away from the main interface.
