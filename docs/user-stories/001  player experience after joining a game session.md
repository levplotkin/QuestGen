As a player, after I join a game session, if I already have a character, 
I want to see a concise reminder of the ongoing story and a clear description of my current situation, so I can immediately understand the context before taking any actions. 
If it’s my first time in the session and I don’t have a character, I should be redirected to the character creation process before proceeding.

Acceptance Criteria:

After joining a session, the system checks if the player has an existing character for this session.

If the player does not have a character, they are automatically redirected to the character creation page and prompted to complete their character before continuing.

If the player has a character:
The interface displays a short summary of the story so far, including key events and party status.
The current situation for the character is described, including location, nearby NPCs or threats, and any important objectives.
The player is clearly prompted that they can now take their next action.
The transition between joining, character creation (if needed), and receiving story context is seamless and intuitive.
