As a player, I want to create a new game session by either selecting from a list of predefined stories or requesting a new story based on my own description, 
so that I can quickly start a D&D adventure that matches my interests and preferences.

Acceptance Criteria:

On the “Create Game Session” page, the player is presented with a list of available predefined stories (including brief summaries).

The player can select a predefined story to use as the campaign for the new session.

Alternatively, the player can provide a custom description or prompt to request the creation of a new, AI-generated story.

The system confirms the selected or generated story and displays a summary for player review.

The player can name the session and set basic options (e.g., max players, privacy, who will be the GM, if any characters can be managed by AI - NPC/real user).

Upon confirmation, the session is created and appears in the list of active sessions, ready for players to join.

If the player is the session creator, they are automatically joined to the new session as the first participant.
